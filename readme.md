# Welcome to the BCA Study Notes Git Repository!

This repository contains a collection of study notes for the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) course. The notes cover a range of topics such as programming, database management, networking, operating systems, web technologies, and more.

These notes have been compiled and curated over the course of several semesters, with the aim of providing students with a comprehensive reference guide for their studies. I hope that you find them useful in your academic pursuits.

To access the notes, simply navigate to the webstie (https://pravin-hub-rgb.github.io/BCA/) and select the topic you wish to study.

Happy studying
