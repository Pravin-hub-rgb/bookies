            <h2>Book overview</h2>
            <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert T. Kiyosaki is a personal finance classic that presents fundamental
                principles of financial literacy and wealth creation through the author's experiences and contrasting
                teachings from two father figures: his biological father (referred to as "Poor Dad") and the father of
                his childhood friend (referred to as "Rich Dad").</p>
            <p>Key concepts and themes discussed in "Rich Dad Poor Dad":</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mindset Shift: Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of shifting from a mindset of working for money
                    (as taught by Poor Dad) to one of making money work for you (as taught by Rich Dad). This shift
                    involves understanding the difference between assets (things that generate income) and liabilities
                    (things that drain money).</li>
                <li>Financial Education: The book advocates for financial education beyond traditional schooling. It
                    highlights the value of self-education in areas such as investing, understanding financial
                    statements, and recognizing opportunities to create passive income streams.</li>
                <li>Importance of Assets: Rich Dad emphasizes the significance of acquiring income-generating assets,
                    such as real estate, stocks, and businesses, as a path to financial independence. The book
                    encourages readers to focus on building a portfolio of assets that provide passive income rather
                    than relying solely on earned income from a job.</li>
                <li>Debunking Myths: Kiyosaki challenges common financial myths, such as the belief that homeownership
                    is always a good investment or that a high income guarantees financial security. He stresses the
                    need to think critically about financial decisions and to avoid falling into societal traps of
                    consumerism and debt.</li>
                <li>Entrepreneurial Mindset: Rich Dad's teachings promote an entrepreneurial mindset, emphasizing
                    creativity, problem-solving, and seizing opportunities. The book encourages readers to think like
                    business owners and investors, even if they are employed in traditional jobs.</li>
                <li>Financial Independence: The ultimate goal advocated in "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is achieving financial
                    independence, where passive income from investments and assets covers living expenses. This concept
                    contrasts with the traditional model of working until retirement age and relying solely on savings
                    and pensions.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, "Rich Dad Poor Dad" provides a foundation for understanding key financial principles, challenges
                conventional beliefs about money and success, and encourages readers to take control of their financial
                destiny through education, smart investments, and a shift in mindset.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 1: Rich Dad, Poor Dad</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In Chapter 1 of "Rich Dad Poor Dad," Robert Kiyosaki lays the foundation for his financial
                    philosophy by presenting contrasting viewpoints through the figures of his two "dads": his
                    biological father (Poor Dad) and the father of his childhood friend (Rich Dad). These two
                    individuals represent not just specific people in Kiyosaki's life but also symbolize broader
                    attitudes and approaches toward money, work, and wealth.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Dad</strong>, a well-educated man with a stable job as an academic, epitomizes the
                    traditional path to financial security. He believed in the conventional wisdom of getting a good
                    education, finding a steady job with benefits, and working hard to earn a paycheck. Poor Dad valued
                    job security and relied on his paycheck to meet his family's needs. He prioritized academic success
                    and encouraged Kiyosaki to excel in school, hoping it would lead to a prosperous career.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Dad</strong>, in contrast, was not highly educated in the formal sense but possessed a
                    wealth of financial knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit. He believed in the power of financial
                    education, emphasizing the importance of learning about money, investing, and creating assets that
                    generate passive income. Rich Dad challenged the notion of working for money and instead advocated
                    making money work for oneself through smart investments and business ventures.</li>
                <li>Kiyosaki uses these contrasting viewpoints to illustrate broader concepts about financial literacy
                    and mindset. One real-life example from the chapter is how Rich Dad taught Kiyosaki and his friend
                    about the value of financial independence at an early age. Rich Dad engaged them in small
                    entrepreneurial activities, such as buying and selling collectible coins or renting out comic books,
                    which provided practical lessons in money management, risk-taking, and the concept of assets
                    generating income.</li>
                <li>Through these contrasting experiences and teachings, Kiyosaki introduces readers to fundamental
                    concepts about financial literacy, mindset, and the role of education in achieving financial
                    success. The chapter sets the stage for deeper exploration in subsequent chapters, where Kiyosaki
                    delves into topics like the importance of financial education, the difference between assets and
                    liabilities, and strategies for building wealth and financial independence.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kiyosaki emphasizes that traditional education often falls short in teaching practical
                            financial skills. Poor Dad, despite being well-educated in academic terms, lacked essential
                            financial knowledge, relying solely on his job for income and struggling with debt and
                            expenses. This highlights the importance of financial education beyond formal schooling, a
                            concept that Rich Dad strongly advocated.</li>
                        <li>Rich Dad's teachings revolve around the idea of making money work for you rather than being
                            a slave to money. He introduced Kiyosaki and his friend to the concept of assets and
                            liabilities. Assets are things that put money in your pocket, such as investments, rental
                            properties, or business ventures, while liabilities are things that take money out of your
                            pocket, like loans, mortgages, and expenses. Rich Dad stressed the importance of acquiring
                            assets that generate passive income to achieve financial freedom.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, Kiyosaki delves into the mindset required for financial success. Rich Dad
                            believed in thinking outside the box, taking calculated risks, and learning from failures.
                            He encouraged a mindset of abundance and opportunity, contrasting with Poor Dad's more
                            cautious and limited mindset focused on job security.</li>
                    </ul>
